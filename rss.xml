            <title><![CDATA[THE POWER OF LATE-NIGHT SNACKING]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>THE POWER OF LATE-NIGHT SNACKING</h1>,<h2>LIZ SWANN MILLER FOR THE INTERNET MARKETING MOM| OCTOBER 31, 2017</h2>,<p>You’re staring at your computer screen with weary eyes. Dinner has come and gone, but that oh-so-familiar beast we call Hunger has reeled its damn head again.</p>,<p>But you can’t snack after eight o’clock, right? That’s weight loss rule number one. Or is it?</p>,<p>I’m about to share with you some helpful truths for a situation of this kind.</p>,<p>There’s an ironic flipside to my mostly honorable label of ‘Liz Swann Miller – Weight Loss Expert’. I must strictly resign myself to the continuous expectation the general public attributes to the title – that I have it together.</p>,<p>Liz would never gain excessive amounts of weight. Liz would never give in to that looming golden M on the highway. Liz doesn’t snack late at night. How does Liz do it?</p>,<p>Let me tell you a secret. Liz struggles. Liz feels the exact temptations you feel, and resists the exact pulls you resist.</p>,<p>As this ‘Weight Loss Expert’, I often need to remind myself not only to pursue a healthy lifestyle in order to fulfill the expectation of my title and my career, but for my optimal wellbeing.</p>,<p>The temptation, for me, is at its worst late at night, during that time when I’ve supposedly declared eating over, yet I’m fighting hunger, bleary-eyed, answering hundreds of emails from clients seeking advice for topics such as this.</p>,<p>Firstly – it’s important to note that hunger is a basic survival instinct – and we must be grateful for it. The fact that it exists is an amazing feat in itself. Don’t be ashamed. Just know how to appease the beast.</p>,<p>There are those who claim the most effective diets are those which have you eating only two meals a day, and drinking water for the rest. I strongly encourage you to ignore these methods, as they are not sustainable.</p>,<p>The secret is snacking. And I don’t mean digging around in a bag of chips and licking the salt off your fingers (we’ve all been there), I mean pouring yourself a bowl of organic nuts. Or blueberries. Or frozen peas. Be inventive, but clever about it. Choose the right food in moderation.</p>,<p>But let’s talk about the late-night secret. It’s simple. And easy. Are you ready for it?</p>,<p>Okay. It’s a cup of tea. Don’t underestimate those three words. Not to drink immediately before bed, but rather in the gap between dinner and sleep.</p>,<p>My go-to is the always delicious, always sufficient <strong><a href="http://bit.ly/2m2dg8R" title="Red Tea">Red Tea</a></strong>. It satisfies the hunger itch, but leaves me feeling clean, calm and revitalized, primarily due to its detoxifying properties. And it’s caffeine free – so don’t fear, you won’t be bouncing from the walls.</p>,<p>After my extensive studies around fat-burning solutions, the myths and the answers, I created this tea with ingredients selected carefully for late night cravings and overall weight loss (you can find the recipe in the link below). The benefits are endless, but the solution is simple.</p>,<p>Set yourself a challenge. I’ll be right there with you. Ditch the chips, the ice cream, and the guilty pleasure cheese blocks. Get the kettle bubbling and pour yourself a steaming mug of Red Tea. I guarantee – you will fall in love with the taste – and late night cravings will be a beast of the past.</p>,<p>To get the Red Tea recipe, please <strong><a href="http://bit.ly/2m2dg8R" title="The Red Tea Detox">The Red Tea Detox today</a></strong>.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[7 Reasons Why To Become A Work-From-Home Mom]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/eb33a7bf-8fcc-4360-9707-4428cd34cdf1.jpg">,<h1><strong>7 Reasons Why To Become A Work-From-Home Mom</strong></h1>,<p>It’s been often said that “necessity is the mother of all inventions”. Which is true.</p>,<p>Thousands of women worldwide have found a challenge to keep a balance between a successful career and being a successful mom.</p>,<p>And when the time comes, thousands of women, too, have found some dismal when taking a decision on which path to take when it comes to both worlds.</p>,<p>Here are 7 ‘magical’ reasons why a woman would want to become a ‘work-from-home’ Mom.</p>,<p><strong>You will have more time for your kids.</strong></p>,<p>Becoming a work-from-home-mom means that you are definitely going to spend more time with them and become a more important part of their life. Although it might cut both ways, you are going to have the time to create more balance. Not all of the time will be for them, but you will definitely have more.</p>,<p>You will not miss any milestones like when they first make a childish-groundbreaking realization like when the pets do not brush their teeth with regular toothpaste or when they start speaking and mumbling those words like “Da-da” or “Mo-mmy”.</p>,<p><strong>Increase your income</strong></p>,<p><em>Isn’t saving money another form of increasing your income?</em> Take pen and paper and outline the benefits of investing more energy in your project and how much of a savings you are having from no-longer-necessary environmental costs of going out that often.</p>,<p><strong>Having the perfect balance for the ideal life</strong></p>,<p>Let’s be clear: We all want to be our own bosses, spend more time with our families and give them a better quality of life. If more time for you means more quality of life, then you got an ace with this one.</p>,<p><strong>More flexibility for your schedule</strong></p>,<p>Think about this: Have you ever had to ask your boss for permission to leave work earlier to pick one of your kids or visiting the infirmary?</p>,<p>With such flexibility, you will have an extended empowerment towards your schedule and timetables. Either at the beginning or at the end of the day, you will have the insight on how much power you have over your life.</p>,<p><strong>Have Additional Time</strong></p>,<p>One way or another, if you make the math on how much time you spend in round trips to pick up your kids at school and other earrings, you will realize on what a big deal of time you have lost in a simple routine.</p>,<p>Roll that over to days, weeks, months and years, still a great deal of time that you will save instead dedicating that time to the, with your work-from-home endeavor.</p>,<p><strong>Gaining more money as an independent than at office</strong></p>,<p>According to the <em><strong>World Economic Forum,</strong></em> in their <em><strong><a href="http://reports.weforum.org/global-gender-gap-report-2017/" title="Global Gender Gap Report 2017">Global Gender Gap Report 2017</a>, </strong></em>women are more often to work in industries where the wages are lower than men.</p>,<p>But, what happens when you work at home? You get to raise the bar for yourself. All of that income will be yours to keep and you can gain more opportunities to find one sweet hotspot that will make more money for you to keep.</p>,<p><strong>Dodge the office social distractions</strong></p>,<p>We all know that once in while is OK to go out with friends and have fun or some sort of distraction. But often happens that we cannot keep up to date with wo many invitations, meetings, dinners, and other social <em>rendez-vous </em>that take place at an office. Instead, you can just stay at home, watch a family movie with your children and have a heck lot of fun!</p>,<h3><strong>A few more hints</strong></h3>,<p>Why not doing both? More and more people are joining a work-from-home environment and looking forward to more freedom, flexibility, more income and a happier life.</p>,<p>Being a work-from-home mom may be a long-lasting desire and dream that wants to unfold. Get the signs from the universe. Follow your heart and your guts.</p>,<p>Present day advancements in technology and globalization will make this striving desire easier, joyful and challenging. Internet is a vast highway that will allow you to connect with more people, and more opportunitiesthan just being realizing other peoples’ dreams working for a company at an office.</p>,<p><em><strong>Note: If you are truly interested in finding options to become an independent-work-from-home-mom, you may want to check <a href="http://bit.ly/theinternetmarketingmom" title="Make Money From Home">this option</a>.</strong></em></p>,<p><em>As you may understand, we are a website that needs compensation to operate like any other website on the internet.
